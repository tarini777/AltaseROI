## Enhanced ROI Calculation Methodology

The tool calculates potential ROI based on ATLASE white paper insights with technology complexity considerations:

### Technology Complexity Factors
- **Data Source Count**: More sources = higher complexity (1.1x - 1.5x multiplier)
- **Integration Patterns**: More patterns = higher complexity (1.1x - 1.4x multiplier)
- **Legacy Systems**: Higher legacy percentage = higher complexity (1.1x - 1.6x multiplier)
- **Cloud Adoption**: Lower cloud adoption = higher migration complexity (1.1x - 1.4x multiplier)
- **Overall Complexity**: High/Medium/Low rating affects final multiplier

### Data Scientist Efficiency
- **Current State**: 50-80% time spent on data preparation (industry average: 65%)
- **ATLASE Target**: 20% data preparation time
- **Savings**: 60-80% reduction in data prep time

### Data Duplication Elimination
- **"Store Once, View Many" Approach**: Eliminates 60-80% of data duplication
- **Cost Savings**: Based on current duplication costs

### Compliance & Risk Reduction
- **50% Reduction**: In compliance violations and audit failures
- **Risk Mitigation**: Through improved data governance

### Time-to-Insight Acceleration
- **70% Reduction**: In time from data request to actionable insights
- **Revenue Impact**: 10% of monthly revenue affected by delayed insights

### Manual Integration Savings
- **80% Reduction**: In manual data integration costs
- **Governance Consistency**: Automated processes reduce inconsistencies

## Maturity Scoring Logic

### Individual Pillar Scoring
- Each question has a weight of 1-4 based on response quality
- Pillar score = (Total weighted score / Maximum possible score) √ó 100
- Maximum score per pillar = 4 points √ó number of questions

### Overall Maturity Level
- **Basic**: 0-39%
- **Intermediate**: 40-59%
- **Advanced**: 60-79%
- **Optimized**: 80-100%

## Enhanced ROI Calculation Details

### Technology Complexity Multiplier
- **Data Sources**: 1.1x (2-5 sources) to 1.5x (10+ sources)
- **Integration Patterns**: 1.1x (1-3 patterns) to 1.4x (5+ patterns)
- **Legacy Systems**: 1.1x (10-25%) to 1.6x (50%+)
- **Cloud Adoption**: 1.1x (50-80%) to 1.4x (<20%)
- **Overall Complexity**: 1.2x (medium) to 1.5x (high)
- **Maximum Multiplier**: Capped at 3.0x

### Implementation Cost Estimation
- Based on maturity gap (100% - current maturity score)
- Estimated as 5% of annual revenue √ó maturity gap percentage √ó complexity multiplier
- Accounts for varying complexity based on current state and technology landscape

### Payback Period
- Implementation cost √∑ Total annual savings
- Expressed in months
- Typically 2-6 months for most organizations
